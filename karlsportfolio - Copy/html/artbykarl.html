The purpose of this page is to showcase a small selection of art work produced by Karl Nadin during his education and earlier years with the express intention of attracting future employers within the web development industry.  Web development and more specifically, web design, has its roots in graphic design.  Life drawing in particular is intrinsic to the subject as a whole.

    <p id="account1">While studying Graphic Design at <a id="hop" href="https://www.hopwood.ac.uk"  target="_blank">Hopwood Hall FE College</a> Middleton campus, Manchester, Colourful Lady II became one of my favourite pieces of art that I have produced.  Although many would think of graphic design as exactly that, comprising more design orientated tasks, life drawing was and still is an integral and fundamental part of the subject.  The bright colours in this piece are what really caused me to fall in love with the work years later.</p>

    <h3 id="name">Bulldozer (1991 In Lino Print)</h3>
    <p id="account">My time at Hopwood Hall during the early 1990's also allowed me to study at the Rochdale campus.  After a number of attempts at lino prints back in my school days, I created Bulldozer at Hopwood Rochdale.  The minimal yet bold colour scheme is one I find very powerful and again, a reason why this work is one of my favourite pieces.  Despite Bulldozer being almost 30 years old I think the work is very relevant given the global issues we see we see in the natural world today.</p>

    <p id="account1">Although in my youth I was a huge fan of the bicycle, and still am, I was never really interested in motorbikes.  That was probably driven by the incentive to stay alive, or at least able bodied!  This particular art work gives me great pride.  Looking back I was trying to demonstrate accuracy, or attention to detail.  This drawing is an eye to hand copy straight from out of a motorcycle magazine of the time.  If I remember anything about the time I spent creating this drawing, it was how my ‘patience’ amusingly annoyed my then art teacher Mr Chris Moxley.</p>

    <h3 id="name">My Shoes (1992)</h3>
    <p id="account">‘My Shoes’ was my first piece for the BTEC National Diploma in Graphic Design at Hopwood Hall College in Middleton.  The purpose of the brief was to describe your hopes and aspirations for the future, and personally to try and depict a live subject in art as something other than what you actually see.  Using only light and shade to guide me, I was able to turn a relatively boring pair of shoes into something that could be seen as being uniquely different.</p>

    <h3 id="name1">The Eye (29.03.2016)</h3>
    <p id="account1">In the event that my old college work would prove insufficient I produced some new art.  In spite of my reluctance I think this went down well at the now <a id="larts" href="https://www.leeds-art.ac.uk"  target="_blank">Leeds Arts University</a>. I studied here Leeds Art University for the 2016 – 2017 academic year.  Replicating the human eye was never one of my stronger attributes when it came to live drawing. Although this was copied from a photograph I am fairly pleased with the outcome.</p>

    <h3 id="name">Colourful Lady (circ 1991)</h3>
    <p id="account">Here is probably my first experience into working with live models at Hopwood Hall, Rochdale.  Displaying some great qualities in terms of color this is another piece I enjoy looking back at.</p>
